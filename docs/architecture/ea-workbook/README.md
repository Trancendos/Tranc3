# EA / CMDB Workbook

An 18-file CSV configuration-management-database (CMDB) layer describing Trancendos's
operational estate: business services → technical services → applications → APIs →
deployments, down through environments, hosting, servers, databases, storage, DNS,
load balancers, firewalls, dependencies, vulnerability findings, and configuration
drift.

**Scope note:** every row is seeded from 6 real anchor services (see below), out of the
90+ services listed in `CLAUDE.md`'s worker map. This is intentionally a depth-first
anchor set, not a full inventory — treat any row for a service not in the anchor table
as illustrative/unverified until it's added and checked against real code the same way
the anchor rows were. CI validates only structural CSV integrity
(`scripts/validate_ea_workbook.py`, wired into `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml` and
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) — it does not verify that a row's claims still match the code.

`scripts/register_ea_workbook_services.py` reads `02_service_inventory.csv`'s
`HealthCheckPath`/`HealthCheckInterval` columns and registers each anchor service with
`health-aggregator`'s dynamic registry (`POST /services`), so this data actually drives
live monitoring instead of only being read by humans. It now runs automatically from
`.forgejo/workflows/deploy-self-hosted.yml`'s `verify-and-register-self-hosted` job
(alongside `scripts/post_deploy_verify.py`), both as best-effort/`--soft` steps.

`Trancendos_Master_Service_Matrix.xlsx` (this directory) is a companion workbook mirroring
the same 8 components (the 6 CSV anchors plus Traefik and health-aggregator) in a
service/route/endpoint/dependency/security/deployment matrix format, plus a broad
structural scan of all 94 real `workers/*` directories and a real, non-fictional
Improvement Roadmap of gaps found while building it. Regenerate it with
`python scripts/build_master_service_matrix.py` after updating the facts baked into that
script — it is not hand-edited directly.

`scripts/check_master_matrix_freshness.py` closes the loop so that regeneration step
isn't just a manual convention: it re-runs the generator against current repo state and
diffs every sheet's cell values (ignoring openpyxl's save-time file metadata) against
the committed workbook, failing CI if they've drifted apart. It runs as part of
`.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml`'s `smoke` job on every push and on pull requests targeting
`main`, so a PR that changes `docker-compose.production.yml`, `workers/*`, or the
generator script without re-running the generator gets caught when one of its scanned
inputs changes, instead of silently shipping a stale workbook.

## Why this exists

`PLATFORM_ENTITIES.md` and `docs/architecture/master-schema.md` answer *who owns what*
(the 43 named locations, their Lead AIs, and the Tier 1–5 `PID-/AID-/SID-/NID-` identity
taxonomy). This workbook answers a different question — *what infrastructure actually
runs, how it's wired, and what's out of compliance* — the operational gaps called out in
the platform architecture review: no server inventory, no DB topology, no deployment
runbooks, no SLA/dependency mapping, no vulnerability tracking.

**This workbook does not mint new AI/agent identities.** `Owner` columns reference the
Tier 3 Lead AI names already canonical in `PLATFORM_ENTITIES.md` / `CLAUDE.md`. Entity IDs
in this workbook (`SRV-`, `APP-`, `DB-`, `STO-`, …) are infrastructure/CMDB keys — a
different axis from the `PID-/AID-/SID-/NID-` AI-tier IDs and never overlap with them.

## Grounding — seeded from real services, not placeholders

Rows are seeded from six services already live or partial in this repo, per `CLAUDE.md`:

| Anchor | Location | Owner (Tier 3) | Code path | Port |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SPARK | The Spark (MCP tool registry) | Norman Hawkins | `src/mcp/` | mounted on tranc3-backend :8000 |
| GRID | The Digital Grid (workflow engine) | Tyler Towncroft | `src/workflow/`, `workers/workflow-engine-service/` | 8034 |
| INF | Infinity (OAuth2/SSO) | The Guardian (Anchor: Orb of Orisis) | `workers/infinity-auth/` | 8005 |
| VOID | The Void (secrets vault) | Prometheus | `workers/vault-service/` | 8038 |
| WORKSHOP | The Workshop (Forgejo CI/CD) | Larry Lowhammer | `deploy/forgejo/` | 3456 |
| OBS | The Observatory (audit/monitoring) | Norman Hawkins | `src/observability/`, `workers/observatory/` | 8065 |

Infrastructure follows the **zero-cost self-hosted architecture** (`CLAUDE.md` §Architecture):
Docker Compose + Traefik + SQLite + local/IPFS storage — no AWS ARNs, no S3, no RDS. The
production Docker host is modelled as server `SRV-CITADEL-01`, matching **The Citadel**
(Trancendos's DevOps fortress entity). Security scan rows use the tools already wired into
this repo's pre-commit hooks and `.forgejo/workflows/security-scan.yml`: bandit, pip-audit,
safety, semgrep, gitleaks, and Trivy for container images.

## Companion documents

Three docs alongside the CSVs turn the CMDB from a static inventory into something
operationally usable:

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| `runbooks.md` | Health-check, restart, scaling, rollback, and selected recovery procedures for the anchor services — written for this platform's actual Docker Compose + Traefik + Forgejo stack, not Kubernetes/AWS. Defers to `deploy/forgejo/RUNBOOK.md` for The Workshop, which already has a dedicated, more detailed runbook. |
| `api-spec-template.md` | Reusable OpenAPI 3.1 skeleton plus a worked example (`API-SPARK-001`) kept in sync with `05_apis.csv`, and the API versioning strategy. |
| `compliance-and-pipeline.md` | ITIL/SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA/ISO 27001 control mapping onto this workbook's columns, and the deployment pipeline as it actually runs through `.forgejo/workflows/` and `docker compose`, including rollback and approval procedure. |

Each CSV here uses a **core column subset** of the originating 17-file workbook spec —
the identifying, ownership, SLA, health-check, dependency, and status columns that
matter for day-one use. Free-text JSON-blob columns from the source spec (e.g. deployment
`HealthCheckDetails`, `PerformanceBaseline`, `SecurityScanDetails` as embedded JSON strings)
were dropped from this seed to keep the CSVs trivially parseable without quoting; add them
back with proper CSV quoting if/when this becomes a live, tool-populated CMDB rather than a
hand-seeded reference. Data types and validation rules for every column follow the
originating spec's conventions (Code/Text/Integer/Boolean/List with `;`-separated multi-values,
`STS-`/`CRT-`/`DC-` style lookup codes, etc.).

## Validation rules that apply across files

- Every `Owner` column must be a valid Tier 3 Lead AI name from `PLATFORM_ENTITIES.md`.
- `RPO` (Recovery Point Objective, max acceptable data loss) and `RTO` (Recovery Time Objective, max acceptable downtime) are independent targets set per service criticality — neither is required to be greater than the other. Both should tighten with higher service criticality — note `CriticalityCode` is inverted (CRT-001 is the *highest* criticality), so CRT-001 services should carry the **lowest** RPO/RTO minutes.
- `SLA` must be **>= 99.0%** for any row with `CriticalityCode = CRT-001` (Critical).
- Cross-references (`DependsOnServices`, `ServiceID`, `ApplicationID`, etc.) must resolve to a row in the referenced file.
- `HostingModel` should be `HST-003` (Self Hosted) unless a service has an explicit, documented reason to run elsewhere (e.g. Fly.io during the Cloudflare Workers → self-hosted migration).

## Next steps to make this a live CMDB rather than a static seed

1. Extend the six anchor services to the remaining ~85 workers in the `docker-compose.production.yml` port table.
2. Either keep this as versioned CSV under `docs/architecture/`, or load it into a queryable store (e.g. a `cmdb` schema in Postgres/SQLite under `src/database/`) with the same columns as tables.
3. Wire `16_vulnerability_scans.csv` and `17_configuration_baseline.csv` to be generated automatically from `.forgejo/workflows/security-scan.yml` / `dependency-audit.yml` output rather than hand-maintained.
