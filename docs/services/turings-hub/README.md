# Service Doc-Pack — Turing's Hub (AI Personality Creation Centre)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Entity** | Turing's Hub |
| **Lead AI** | Samantha Turing |
| **Status** | 🔧 Partial (per `CLAUDE.md` service table) |
| **Code** | `src/personality/` |
| **HTTP surface** | `/turingshub/*` router — mounted in `api.py` (`app.include_router(_turingshub_router)`) |
| **Gate tier** | Partial → GOV + DDD (scoped) + RACI + SIM + ASD + TFM + POL + STD |

> **Truthfulness:** claims cite `src/personality/`. Implementation status is owned by the
> `CLAUDE.md` service table; identity/ownership by `PLATFORM_ENTITIES.md`.

## 1. Service Governance Charter (GOV)

- **Mission:** Turing's Hub is the AI personality creation centre — it curates personality profiles
  and spawns new personality micro-services from a template.
- **Owner (RACI-A):** Samantha Turing (Lead AI).
- **Scope (current):** a `/turingshub` router over a `PersonalityMatrix` (profile registry) and a
  `PersonalitySpawner` (code generator). **Out of scope (current):** a hosted UI; spawning is an API
  + filesystem operation.

## 2. Detailed Design Document (DDD)

### HTTP surface (`src/personality/turingshub/routes.py`, prefix `/turingshub`)
| Method | Route | Backing code |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/turingshub/status` | spawner (profile count + list) — the route uses only the spawner; the matrix is not touched here |
| GET | `/turingshub/personalities` | iterates `list(spawner._profiles.keys())` (the route's `list_profiles` `hasattr` guard is dead — that method is on `PersonalityMatrix`, not the spawner — so it takes the `_profiles` fallback), returning `{id, profile}` per id |
| GET | `/turingshub/personalities/{personality_id}` | profile lookup |
| POST | `/turingshub/spawn` | `PersonalitySpawner.spawn(...)` |
| GET | `/turingshub/matrix/active` | **PARTIAL** — returns `{active_personality}`, but `PersonalityMatrix` has no active-personality tracking, so the value is currently `null` (an "active" concept is PLANNED). The `_matrix()` import was corrected here to `PersonalityMatrix` (the old `EnhancedPersonalityMatrix` import raised and forced the error fallback) |

### Core (`src/personality/`)
- **`matrix.py`** — `PersonalityProfile` (load/save JSON, `build_system_prompt(user_context)`) and
  `PersonalityMatrix` (loads all profiles from `src/personality/profiles/`, `get` / `list_profiles` /
  `register`). **44** profile JSONs ship in `profiles/`. Wired into `api.py` as
  `EnhancedPersonalityMatrix` (import-guarded).
- **`spawner.py`** — `PersonalitySpawner.spawn(...)` generates a full personality micro-repo:
  `_write_config`, `_write_active_profile`, `_write_env_example`, `_write_api`, `_write_readme`,
  `_write_requirements`, `_write_docker`. Output base resolved via `_resolve_output_base` (sandboxed).
- **`lnn.py`** — liquid neural network; **`snn_qat.py`** — spiking NN quantization-aware training.
  Research modules in the personality package (not on the `/turingshub` router).
- **`profiles/`** — 44 JSON profiles. Note: `vesper-nightingale`, `atlas-meridian` are internal
  legacy profiles, **not** platform entities (per `CLAUDE.md` naming rules).

## 3. Technical Architecture Solutions Design (TASD)

- **Style:** registry + code-generator. The matrix is an in-memory profile store loaded from disk;
  the spawner is a template-driven file emitter.
- **Decision:** personalities are **data** (JSON profiles) + a generator, not bespoke code per
  personality — new personalities are added as profiles and materialised on demand via `spawn`.

## 4. RACI Matrix

| Activity | Samantha Turing (Lead) | Platform Owner | The Chaos Party | The Observatory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Profile registry (matrix) | **R/A** | C | I | I |
| Personality spawning | **R/A** | C | R | I |
| Profile schema/standards | **R/A** | C | I | I |

## 5. Solutions Integration Model (SIM)

- **Upstream:** `api.py` mounts `/turingshub`. It also *attempts* to instantiate
  `EnhancedPersonalityMatrix` (an alias of `PersonalityMatrix`) at startup, but currently passes a
  config object where `PersonalityMatrix.__init__` expects a `profiles_dir` path — so that call
  raises and `personality_matrix` is left unset (fail-soft, logged). **PARTIAL/PLANNED:**
  `PersonalityProfile.build_system_prompt` exists but is **not yet consumed** by any in-repo inference
  path; wiring profiles into prompt construction (and fixing the startup arg) is pending.
- **Downstream:** `spawn` writes a generated personality repo to a sandboxed output base.
- **Auth boundary (current):** the `/turingshub` router does not enforce auth itself; `spawn` writes
  to filesystem — front with platform auth (Infinity) and restrict `spawn` in production (**PLANNED**).

## 6. Architecture Scalability Document (ASD)

- **Load model:** registry reads are O(profiles) at load; `spawn` is an I/O burst (writes a repo).
- **Zero-cost:** pure Python + filesystem; no paid dependency.
- **Degradation:** if `PersonalityMatrix` import fails, `api.py` logs a warning and continues with
  `EnhancedPersonalityMatrix = None` (import-guarded).

## 7. Deployment Scope Matrix (DSM)

- **Mode awareness:** No — this entity's own code does not call `PlatformInfraMode` / `src/platform/infrastructure_mode.py`. (Some platform-wide, cross-cutting code *does* branch on the mode — `src/routers/adaptive.py` and `src/routers/ecosystem.py` read/set `PLATFORM_INFRA_MODE`/`SYSTEM_MODE` directly, and `Dimensional/architecture/storage_factory.py` selects a storage provider from `SYSTEM_MODE` — but none of that code is owned by this or any other one of the 43 named entities; it is shared platform infrastructure, not this service's own logic. The Citadel is the only one of the 43 named entities whose own code branches on the mode — see `docs/services/the-citadel/README.md`.) This entity's deployment scope is determined externally — by which `docker-compose.production.yml` service block runs, and where — not by in-process mode detection.
- **Runtime placement:** two surfaces — a router mounted in the `tranc3-backend` monolith (`src/personality/`, Partial-tier per this pack) *and* a separate standalone worker, `turings-hub-service` (port 8058).
- **Persistence:** the monolith side shares `tranc3-backend`'s volume; `turings-hub-service` itself has **no** named volume in compose.

| Setup | What runs, and where | Data locality | Hard blockers / caveats |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cloud-Only** | monolith router runs wherever `tranc3-backend` is deployed; `turings-hub-service` runs its own compose block on a single cloud host | monolith side volume-backed; standalone worker ephemeral (no volume) | no entity-specific blocker beyond the standalone worker's missing volume |
| **Hybrid** | same two surfaces; per the Hybrid diagram, monolith data can sync to local TrueNAS | as above, monolith side local-syncable | requires `CITADEL_LOCAL_STACK=true` for a local stack alongside the cloud one |
| **Local-Only** | same two surfaces, entirely on local/Citadel hardware | monolith side fully local, volume-backed; standalone worker still has no volume | none beyond standard local-hardware ops |

- **Zero-cost posture per mode:** Cloud-Only defaults to the `zero_cost_cloud` AI-rotation chain; Hybrid/Local-Only default to `zero_cost_full` (`config/platform/infrastructure_mode.yaml`) — this only affects AI-Gateway-routed calls, not this entity's own logic
- **Switching modes:** operator-level via `PLATFORM_INFRA_MODE` (or legacy `SYSTEM_MODE`); no code change needed for either surface.

## 8. Technology Framework Matrix (TFM)

| Concern | Choice | Zero-cost stance |
|---|---|---|
| Profile store | JSON files in `profiles/` | in-repo |
| Prompt assembly | `PersonalityProfile.build_system_prompt` | in-process |
| Code generation | template writers in `spawner.py` | in-process |
| Research NN | `lnn.py`, `snn_qat.py` (PyTorch) | OSS |

## 9. Environment Support Matrix (ESM)

> Grounded against `docker-compose.development.yml` (6 services), `docker-compose.uat.yml` (16 services), and `docker-compose.production.yml` (286 services) — checked by exact compose service name, not assumed.

| Environment | Covered? | What runs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | Partial | the `api` service in `docker-compose.development.yml` runs the monolith router — the standalone `turings-hub-service` worker is **not** in this compose file | standalone worker has zero Dev coverage |
| **UAT** | Partial | same monolith router via `api` in `docker-compose.uat.yml` — the standalone `turings-hub-service` worker is **not** in this compose file either | standalone worker has zero UAT coverage |
| **Production** | Yes | both surfaces — full detail in the DSM above | — |

- **Gap:** the standalone `turings-hub-service` worker (the more complete of this entity's two surfaces, per the DSM above) has **no Dev or UAT environment at all** — the first place it runs is Production. This is the norm for the ~90 standalone workers on this platform, not specific to this entity, but worth stating plainly rather than assuming pre-production validation exists where it doesn't.

## 10. Policy (POL)

- Reuses platform policy (`POL-AI-001`, `docs/defstan/`). Generated repos must not embed secrets —
  `_write_env_example` emits an `.env.example`, never real credentials.

## 11. Procedure (PROC)

- **Add a personality:** drop a profile JSON in `src/personality/profiles/`; it is picked up by
  `PersonalityMatrix._load_all()`. Materialise via `POST /turingshub/spawn`.

## 12. Runbook (RUN)

- **`/turingshub/status` shows matrix unavailable:** `PersonalityMatrix` import failed — check the
  `api.py` startup warning and the `profiles/` directory.
- **`spawn` fails:** verify the resolved output base (`_resolve_output_base`) is writable and inside
  the sandbox; check the returned file list.

## 13. Standards (STD)

- Profiles are JSON with a stable schema (`PersonalityProfile._from_dict`).
- Spawn output is sandboxed via `_resolve_output_base`; no writes outside the resolved base.
